To run instructions:
mkdir login-2fa
cd login-2fa
npm init -y
npm install express body-parser ejs speakeasy qrcode
node app.js

Step-by-Step Verification Process
User logs in:

The user submits their username and password via the /login route.
If the credentials are correct, a temporary secret is generated and a QR code is displayed to the user.
User scans the QR code:

The user scans the QR code with an authenticator app (like Google Authenticator), which generates time-based one-time passwords (TOTP) based on the secret.
User enters the token:

The user submits the token generated by the authenticator app via the /verify route.
Server verifies the token:

The server uses the speakeasy.totp.verify method to check if the token is valid based on the temporary secret.

EJS (Embedded JavaScript) is a simple templating language that lets you generate HTML markup with plain JavaScript. It is often used with Node.js to render dynamic content on web pages by embedding JavaScript code within the HTML

To verify two-factor authentication (2FA), several network features and components are typically utilized to ensure secure and reliable communication. Here are the key network features involved in the process:
1. HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol Secure)
Purpose: Encrypts data between the client (browser) and server to prevent eavesdropping and tampering.
How it's used: All data transmissions, including login credentials and verification tokens, should be sent over HTTPS to ensure they are encrypted and secure.
2. API Endpoints
Purpose: Serve as the endpoints for handling login requests, generating 2FA tokens, and verifying tokens.
How it's used: RESTful API endpoints are defined in the server application to handle different aspects of the authentication process, such as:
/login: Handles user login and generates the 2FA secret and QR code.
/verify: Verifies the 2FA token entered by the user.
3. QR Code Generation
Purpose: Provides an easy way for users to configure their authenticator apps.
How it's used: The server generates a QR code containing the 2FA secret using libraries like qrcode in Node.js. This QR code is then sent to the client for the user to scan.
4. Time-based One-Time Password (TOTP) Algorithm
Purpose: Generates time-based tokens that change periodically.
How it's used: The TOTP algorithm, implemented by libraries like speakeasy in Node.js, generates tokens that the server can verify against the secret stored for the user.
5. Client-Side Form Submission
Purpose: Collects and sends the user's input (e.g., username, password, and 2FA token) to the server.
How it's used: HTML forms and JavaScript are used to submit the user's credentials and 2FA token to the appropriate API endpoints.
6. Session Management
Purpose: Keeps track of the user's authenticated state.
How it's used: After successful 2FA verification, the server creates a session for the user to keep them logged in. This session can be managed using cookies or tokens (e.g., JWT).
Detailed Verification Process Using Network Features
User Login:

User Action: The user enters their username and password in the login form and submits it.
Network Feature: The form data is sent over HTTPS to the /login endpoint.
Server Action: The server verifies the credentials, generates a 2FA secret, and returns a QR code.
Displaying the QR Code:

User Action: The user scans the QR code with an authenticator app (e.g., Google Authenticator).
Network Feature: The QR code is displayed as an image, generated using the qrcode library on the server and embedded in the EJS template.
2FA Token Submission:

User Action: The user enters the 2FA token from their authenticator app and submits it.
Network Feature: The form data, including the token, is sent over HTTPS to the /verify endpoint.
Token Verification:

Server Action: The server uses the TOTP algorithm (speakeasy library) to verify the token against the stored secret.
Outcome:
If the token is valid, the server creates a session for the user and confirms successful 2FA verification.
If the token is invalid, the server responds with an error message.
